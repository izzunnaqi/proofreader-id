Abstract—We  propose a medical named entity recognition  
for  medical  question  answering  system  with  Indonesian 
language.  The  aim  is  to  provide  a  good  medical  named 
entity  grammar  by  only  using  the  available  language 
resource.  Our  strategy  here  is  to  build  the  features  most 
often  used  for  the  recognition  and  classification  of 
medical  named  entities.  We  organize  them  along  two 
different axes: word-level and list features, document and 
corpus features. For the reason we built our own features 
to  Indonesian  medical  named  entities    and  used  it  as  the 
feature  of  the  available  with  SVM  Software.  By  using 
3000  sentences,  the  highest  accuracy  score  achieved  is 
about 90%. 
 
Keywords—Medical  named  entity,  Word-level  features, 
Document and corpus features, SVM engine. 
 

I.  INTRODUCTION 

Medical  named  entity  recognition  is  an  important  and 
difficult  task  in  computational  linguistics  such  as  medical 
question  answering  system.  The  discovery  of  new  and 
potentially  meaningful  relationships  between  named  entities 
in  medical  literature  can  take  great  advantage  from  the 
application of multirelational data mining approaches in text 
mining [7]. In recent years, conditional random fields (CRFs) 
have  shown  good  performance  in  named  entity  recognition 
tasks.  However,  a  direct  application  of  it  to  medical  named 
entity recognition incurs a very high training cost [1]. 

There are many biomedical/medical/clinical named entity 
recognition  (NER)  research  with  various  approach  and 
method.      Many  of  them  utilized  some  classifiers  such  as 
CRFs, SVMs, and biomedical corpus for experiment such as 
GENIA.  

Among  NER research, Cai et al  [5], Chan et al [1], Yang 
investigated 

et  al 
biomedical/medical NER with classifiers such as CRFs.  

[6],  and  Liao  et  al 

[11],  have 

Cai  et  al  [5],  proposed  a  novel  selection  method  for  tri-
training  learning,  using  three  classifiers:  CRFs,  SVMs  and 
ME. In tri-training process, Cai’s select new labeled samples 
based on the selection model maximizing training utility, and 
compute  the  agreement  according  to  the  agreement  scoring 
function.  Chan et al [1], evaluate two alternatives to training 
a  CRFs  with  a  traditional  single-phase  maximum  likelihood 
training  method.  For  the  cascaded  method,  Chan  propose  to 
include  a  "margin"  in  the  model  that  leads  to  better 
recognition  results.  Yang  et  al  [6],  represents  a  two-phase 
approach based on semi-CRFs and novel feature sets. Semi-

CRFs  put  the  label  to  a  segment  not  a  single  word  which  is 
more  natural  than  the  other  machine  learning  methods. 
Yang’s approach divides the whole biomedical NER into two 
sub-tasks:  term  boundary  detection  and  semantic  labeling. 
Liao  et  al  [11],  employ  a  skip-chain  conditional  random 
fields  (CRFs)  model  for  BioNER  (Biomedical  named  entity 
recognition).  This  model  completely  considers  to  the  long-
range dependencies about biomedical information. 

Gong  et  al  [4],  Cai  et  al  [5],  and  Liao  et  al  [11],  have 
employed  biomedical  NER  approaches  that  exploit  GENIA 
corpus  for  experiment  and  the  experiment  result  achieves 
precision, recall and F-score of the best. 

Gong  et  al  [4],  presents  a  hybrid  approach  to  recognize 
biomedical  entity,  which  includes  POS  (Part-of-Speech) 
tagging,  rules-based  and  dictionary-based  approach  using 
biomedical  ontology.  By  using  the  GENIA  3.02  corpus  for 
aiding  biologist  tagging  biomedical  entity  in  the  biomedical 
literature and obtain a recall of 66%, a precision of 78% and 
an F-score 71.5%. Cai et al [5], using the GENIA corpus for 
experiment,  show  that  Cai’s  proposed  tri-training  learning 
approach  can  more  effectively  and  stably  exploit  unlabeled 
data.  Liao  et  al  [11],  using  the  GENIA  corpus  for  testing, 
their    approach  obtains  significant  improvement  over  other 
methods,  which  achieves  72.8%  for  precision,  73.6%  for 
recall and 73.2% for F-score.  

An other research with propose a new novelty for clicical 
NER  such  as  Dehghan    et  al  [2],  explores  a  variety  of 
common  challenges 
faced  by  clinical  named  entity 
recognition  and  classification  methods  as  well  as  current 
approaches  to  handling  them.  Gu  et  al  [3],  propose  a  novel 
approach  aimed  at  minimizing  the  annotation  requirement. 
The Gu’s idea is to use a dictionary which is essentially a list 
of entity  names compiled by  domain experts and sometimes 
more readily available than domain experts themselves.  

Colmenar et al [8], presents a Named Entity Recognition 
(NER) system based on Hidden Markov Models. The system 
design is language independent, and the target language and 
scope  of  the  NER  is  determined  by  the  training  corpus. 
Fatiha [9], develop a tool for extracting named entities from 
free  French  reports.  A  rule-based  approach  is  applied  to 
clinical  reports  corpus  of  infectious  diseases  to  extract 
semantic  content 
the  form  of  named  entities  and 
properties.  Two  objectives  can  be  achieved  through  this 
work;  (1)  the  patient  data  anonymization  and  (2)  the 
structured  database  fill  in  dedicated  for  future  medical 
applications.

II.  RELATED WORK 

There  are 

two  main  approaches  for  named  entity 
recognition 
:  manual  and  automatic.  Named  entity 
recognition  using  manual  such  as  Dehghan  et  al  [2], 
identification  and  classification  of  mentions  of  relevant 
clinical concepts is a crucial preprocessing step in designing 
and developing clinical decision support systems. While this 
task has gained significant attention in recent years, there are 
still a number of issues that need further investigation. Apice 
et  al  [7],  investigate  the  application  of  such  an  approach  to 
address 
informative  syntactic 
structures, which are frequent in biomedical abstract corpora. 
Initially,  named  entities  are  annotated  in  text  corpora 
according 
to  some  biomedical  dictionary  (e.g.  MeSH 
taxonomy).

sight seeing domain named entities. It is a basic step for the 
following  processing:  question  analysis  and  keyword

the  named  entity  recognition,  we  consider  that  it  can  mine 
exact  information  from  text  document  to  respond  to  user.

complement the results of the other one. Unlike  most of the 
previous  works, 
the 
components  provide  different  results.  This  redundancy  is  an 
advantage  when  human  supervision  is  mandatory  at  the  end 
of the process such as in intelligence environments.

An other related work to adapting SVMs to named entity 
recognition, the multi-class problem and the unbalanced class 
distribution problem become very serious in terms of training 
cost and performance by  Lee et al [14]. Zhang and Elhadad 
[15], propose an unsupervised approach to extracting named 
entities  from  biomedical  text.  A  noun  phrase  chunker 
followed  by  a  filter  based  on  inverse  document  frequency 
extracts  candidate  entities  from  free  text.  Classification  of 
candidate entities into categories of interest is carried out by 
leveraging principles from distributional semantics. 

 
 

III. MEDICAL NAMED ENTITY RECOGNITION FOR MEDICAL 

 

QUESTION ANSWERING 

Most  question  answering  system,  NER  is  typically  used 
as an aid to filter out  strings that do not contain the answer. 
The  NER  is  therefore  used  to  single  out  the  entity  types 
appearing in a text fragment. If a piece of text does not have 
any  entity  with  a  type  compatible  with  the  type  of  the 
expected  answer,  the  text  is  discarded  or  heavily  penalised. 
With  this  in  mind,  the  desiderata  of  a  NER  are  related  with 
the  range  of  entities  to  detect  and  with  the  recall  of  the 
system [12]. 

A  question  answering  system  typically  uses  both  a 
taxonomy  of  expected  answers  and  the  taxonomy  of  named 
entities produced by its NER to identify which 
named  entities  are  relevant  to  a  question  [10].  In  this  paper 
we  combine  between  NER  includes  the  identification  and 
classification  of  certain  proper  nouns  (like  location,  facility, 
diagnosis,  definition  organization,  person,  data,  and  others) 
in a text and medical NE features. Features are descriptors or 
characteristic  attributes  of  words  designed  for  algorithmic 
consumption.  Feature  vector  representation  is  an  abstraction 
over text where typically each word is represented by one or 
many boolean, numeric and nominal values [13].  

Similar  with  medical  question  answering  system,  we 
devide analysis for medical NER into two component such as 
medical  range  entity;  recall  and  precision  medical  NER. 
Following subsections will discuss each component in detail. 
 
A.  Medical range of Entity 

Different  domains  (such  as  medical  or  clinical  or 
biomedical) require different types of answers. Typically, the 
medical  question  classification  component  determines  the 
type  of  medical  question  and  the  type  of  the  expected 
medical answer. In this paper we construct medical range of 
entity  about  medical  taxonomy  based  on  identification  and 
classification of proper nouns. Indonesian medical taxonomy 
shown in table I.

A  problem  that  arises  here  is    the  medical  named 
entity  types  usually  are  not    matched  against  the  types  the 
medical  question  requires.  Consequently,  even  though  a 
medical  question  classifier  could  determine  a  very  specific 
type of medical answer, this type needs to be mapped to the 
types provided by the medical NER features. 

 

185B.  Attribute extraction 

Our  first  challenge  is  to  named  entity  recognize  and 
extract  identifying  as  well  as  sensitive  information  from  the 
unstructured  data  on  the  heterogeneous  data.  We  use  a 
statistical  learning  approach  for  extracting  identifying  and 
sensitive attributes in medical data.  

A  key  to  our  classifier  based  approach  is  the  selection 
of  the  feature  set  based  on  Indonesian  taxonomy.    Once  the 
text is parsed, a set of features is generated for each token or 
term in the medical text. The features of a token contain the 
token  itself  such  as  previous  word,  next  word,  things,  and 
number, etc.  

The use of local features allow our  medical NER to be 
more portable and work across many different types of data. 
Once the medical feature data is generated, we feed them to a 
classifier  for 
that  our  extraction 
component so far only extracts atomic attributes and  we use 
simple heuristics to associate these attributes to an entity. 

  We  note 

training. 

We  will  discuss  in  section  3  about    two  classification 

approaches we studied. 
 
C.  Recall and Precision for medical NER 

Given  that  the  medical  NER  is  used  to  filter  out 
candidate  medical  answers,  it  is  important  that  only  wrong 
answers are removed, while all correct answers stay in the set 
of  possible  answers.  Therefore,  recall  in  a  medical  NER  in 
medical  question  answering 
to  be  preferred  above 
precision.  A  NER  developed  for  a  generic  NE  recognition 
task  is  fine-tuned  for  a  good  balance  between  recall  and 
precision[13].  

is 

In order to increase recall, it is therefore theoretically to 
allow to return multiple labels and then let further modules of 
the  medical  QA  system  do  the  final  filtering  to  detect  the 
exact  answer.  This  is  the  hypothesis  that  we  want  to  test  a 
medical NER that assigns single labels and a variation of the 
medical NER features. 
 

IV.  INDONESIAN MEDICAL NE  FEATURES 

 

Indonesian  medical  named  entities  organize  along  two 
different  axes  such  as  word-level  features,  list  features, 
document  and  corpus  features.  Following  subsections  will 
discuss each component in detail. 

 

A.  Indonesian Medical Word-level  and list features 

Indonesian medical word-level features are related to the 
character makeup of words. They specifically describe word 
case,  punctuation,  numerical  value  and  special  characters. 
Table II lists subcategories of word-level features.

Document  features  are  defined  over  both  Indonesian 
medical  document  content  and  document  structure.    We  list 
in  this  section  features  that  go  beyond  the  single  word  and 
multi-word  expression  and    include  meta-information  about 
indonesian medical documents and corpus statistics.

V.  EXPERIMENTS 

 

A.  Experimental Data 

In our knowledge, we built our own Indonesian medical 
named entity. We collected Indonesian medical articles from 
two  popular  Indonesian  sites  (http://health.detik.com/  and 
detikhealth.com  and  health.kompas.com/konsultasi)  for  data 
years  2013  (after  eliminating  the  similar  medical  entity,  it 
gave  us  1000  medical  sentences  for  each  classification  and 
features). 

 

B.  Experimental Result 

In  the  experiment,  we  used  an  SVM  algorithm  are 
available in the WEKA. For the baseline, we used Indonesian 
medical taxonomy.   

We  compared  the  highest  baseline  result  with  our 
proposed  features  (see  table  IV.  For  the  result  )  :  the 
Indonesian  medical  word  level-list  feature  (WL)  and  the 
Indonesian  medical  document  and  corpus  feature  (DC).  We 
used 5-fold cross validation for the accuracy calculation.

Based  on  table  VI,  the  highest  misclassification  for  the 
Baseline  +  WL  +  DC  system  is  the  “Definistion”  category 
falls  into  “Facility”  category.  This  is  mostly  for  “risiko 
terapi”  named  entity,  such  as  “Kemoterapi  adalah  cara 
memelihara  ketika  telah  melakukan  suatu  operasi,  resiko 
yang  akan  muncul  biasanya  berupa  mual  dan  pusing”.  
Compared  to  the  baseline  +  WL  system  result,  the  full 
feature  gives  better  accuracy  score  almost  for  all  classes 
medical taxonomy. 

Our  initial  experimental  results  show  that  our  medical 
NER  system  effectively  detects  a  variety  of  identifying 
attributes  with  high  precision,  and  provides 
flexible 
identification options that anonymizes the data. It sightseeing 
domain  named  entity  recognition  we  have  got  excellent 
precision  and  recalling  rates.  It  shows  that  our  method  is 
effective  and  can  be  used  in  a  practical  medical  question 
answering system 
 

VI.  CONCLUSION 

 

We presented Indonesian medical name entity recognition as 
well  as  attribute  extraction  for  anonymizing  heterogeneous 
health information including both structured and unstructured 
data.  Our  experiment  showed  that  the  Indonesian  medical 
named  entities  using  SVM  was  organize  for  two  different 
fitures and SVM was able to achieve good accuracy score.
